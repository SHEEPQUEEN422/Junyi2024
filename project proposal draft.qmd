## Title

Reproducibility Project of Rapid Word Learning Under Uncertainty via Cross-Situational Statistics

## Introduction

"Rapid Word Learning Under Uncertainty via Cross-Situational Statistics" by Chen Yu and Linda B. Smith presents the challenges of word learning in natural environments, where there are infinite possible word-referent pairings. Previous approaches have focused on how learners constrain this problem using linguistic, social and representational cues within a single moment or trial. However, the authors propose an alternative strategy: **cross-situational learning**, where learners accumulate statistical information about word-referent pairings across multiple encounters rather than relying on single-trial mapping. The core issue, famously highlighted by Quine (1960), is the indeterminacy of referents in any given instance of language learning, such as when someone says "gavagai" while pointing at a field—it's unclear what exactly the word refers to. Traditional research has shown that children can use constraints to "fast map" words to their referents in a single encounter, but real-world learning environments are usually more ambiguous, with many words and potential referents presented at once.

The authors suggest that learners might solve this indeterminacy problem by tracking the co-occurrences of words and referents across multiple learning trials. Though there have been simulations supporting this idea, there has been little empirical research to show whether humans can engage in such cross-situational statistical learning. This gap in understanding, particularly in highly ambiguous environments, is what the authors aim to address in their experiments.

## Justification for Experiment Choice

As AI systems increasingly aim to replicate human cognitive processes, understanding how individuals learn word-referent pairings under uncertainty offers valuable insights for developing more sophisticated natural language processing models. This experiment explores the mechanisms by which human learners leverage statistical regularities across multiple trials to derive meaning from ambiguous linguistic inputs—paralleling the way machine learning algorithms extract patterns from data. By examining how different conditions of word-referent pairings affect learning outcomes, this research has the potential to inform the design of AI systems capable of learning from limited data and ambiguous contexts, ultimately enhancing their language understanding capabilities. In doing so, this study not only contributes to theoretical discussions on language acquisition but also holds practical implications for advancing AI applications in language-related tasks.

## Subjects

At least 50 workers on Prolific.

## Methods

Utilized slides displaying about 50 unique objects (e.g., canister, facial sauna, rasp) paired with corresponding pseudowords generated by a computer program to adhere to phonotactic norms of English.These pseudowords were produced by a synthetic female voice in a monotone format. Participants were exposed to three distinct learning conditions based on the number of words and referents presented per trial:

**2-2 Condition**: 2 words and 2 pictures

**3-3 Condition**: 3 words and 3 pictures

**4-4 Condition**: 4 words and 4 pictures

Each training trial presented a random pairing of the words with the pictures, without indicating which picture corresponded to which word. Participants experienced six repetitions of each word-referent pair across trials, allowing for exposure to statistical relationships.

To conduct these experiments, we will need to create a series of slides featuring approximately 50 unique objects, each paired with a pseudoword that adheres to the phonotactic norms of English. The stimuli will include images of the objects and corresponding audio clips of the pseudowords produced by a synthetic voice. Each participant will be randomly assigned to one of the learning conditions and exposed to the slides in a controlled environment. The procedures will involve presenting each participant with the learning slides, allowing them to listen to the pseudowords while viewing the corresponding objects. Participants will then complete a test phase where they will be asked to match pseudowords to the correct objects. Throughout this process, data will be collected on the accuracy of their responses to assess their learning performance.

## Results

### Exclusions

**Participant Exclusion**:

1.  Participants may have been excluded if they failed to follow instructions or if there were technical issues during the experiment (e.g., audio or visual stimuli not presented correctly).
2.  Participants could also be excluded if they did not complete the experiment or if their responses suggested they were not engaged (e.g., very low accuracy across the board).

### Data preparation

1.  Accuracy Calculation

    The primary dependent variable in this study is accuracy, defined as the proportion of correctly identified word-referent pairs during the testing phase. For each participant, the researchers would compute accuracy for each learning condition (2 × 2, 3 × 3, and 4 × 4).

2.  Averaging Across Trials

    Participants' accuracy in each condition would be averaged across trials. This would yield a mean accuracy score per condition (e.g., the average accuracy for all 2 × 2 trials, all 3 × 3 trials, etc.).

3.  Outlier & Missing Data Removal

    Outlier participants or trials (e.g., those with extremely high or low response times or accuracy) may have been identified using statistical methods (e.g., z-scores, interquartile range) and removed to ensure that the analysis was not skewed by atypical behavior.

    And if participants missed trials or failed to respond, we need to handle missing data. This might involve excluding incomplete trials or imputing missing values.

### Confirmatory Analysis

#### Primary Hypothesis

The main hypothesis of the study is that participants can learn word-referent pairings across trials using cross-situational statistical learning, even under conditions of high ambiguity.

#### Main Statistical Test

**Repeated measures ANOVA** is the primary statistical test in this research. It is used to compare participants' mean accuracy across the three different conditions (2 × 2, 3 × 3, and 4 × 4).

-   **ANOVA Output**: The ANOVA would provide an **F-statistic**, **degrees of freedom**, and **p-value** to determine whether there are significant differences between conditions.
