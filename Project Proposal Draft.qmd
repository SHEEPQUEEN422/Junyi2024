## Introduction

**Rapid Word Learning Under Uncertainty via Cross-Situational Statistics** by Chen Yu and Linda B. Smith presents the challenges of word learning in natural environments, where there are infinite possible word-referent pairings. Previous approaches have focused on how learners constrain this problem using linguistic, social and representational cues within a single moment or trial. However, the authors propose an alternative strategy: cross-situational learning, where learners accumulate statistical information about word-referent pairings across multiple encounters rather than relying on single-trial mapping. The core issue, famously highlighted by Quine (1960), is the indeterminacy of referents in any given instance of language learning, such as when someone says "gavagai" while pointing at a field—it's unclear what exactly the word refers to. Traditional research has shown that children can use constraints to "fast map" words to their referents in a single encounter, but real-world learning environments are usually more ambiguous, with many words and potential referents presented at once.

The authors suggest that learners might solve this indeterminacy problem by tracking the co-occurrences of words and referents across multiple learning trials. Though there have been simulations supporting this idea, there has been little empirical research to show whether humans can engage in such cross-situational statistical learning. This gap in understanding, particularly in highly ambiguous environments, is what the authors aim to address in their experiments.  


## Methods
50 workers on Prolific received coupons or $7 for their participation.

### Power Analysis

Original effect size, power analysis for samples to achieve 80%, 90%, 95% power to detect that effect size.  Considerations of feasibility for selecting planned sample size.

### Planned Sample

Planned sample size and/or termination rule, sampling frame, known demographics if any, preselection rules if any.

### Materials

The stimuli were slides containing pictures of uncommon objects (e.g., canister, facial sauna, and rasp) paired with auditorily presented pseudowords. These artificial words were generated by a computer program to sample English forms that were broadly phonotactically probable; they were produced by a synthetic female voice in monotone. There were 54 unique objects and 54 unique pseudowords partitioned into three sets of 18 words and referents for use in the three conditions. The training trials were generated by randomly pairing each word with one picture; these were the word-referent pairs to be discovered by the learner. The three learning conditions differed in the number of words and referents presented on each training trial.

Then,participants were exposed to three distinct learning conditions based on the number of words and referents presented per trial:
2-2 Condition: 2 words and 2 pictures
3-3 Condition: 3 words and 3 pictures
4-4 Condition: 4 words and 4 pictures
Each training trial presented a random pairing of the words with the pictures, without indicating which picture corresponded to which word. Participants experienced six repetitions of each word-referent pair across trials, allowing for exposure to statistical relationships.

### Procedure	

The pictures were presented on a 17-in. computer screen, and the sound was played by the speakers connected to the same computer. Subjects were instructed that their task was to learn the words and referents, but they were not told that there was one referent per word. They were told that multiple words and pictures would co-occur on each trial and that their task was to figure out across trials which word went with which picture.
After training in each condition, subjects received a fouralternative forced-choice test of learning. On the test, they were presented with 1 word and 4 pictures and asked to indicate the picture named by that word. The target picture and the 3 foils were all drawn from the set of 18 training pictures.

### Analysis Plan

The **descriptive statistics** (mean number of word-referent pairs discovered) and **inferential statistics** (t-tests comparing performance to chance):

*"Figure 1 shows that in each condition, subjects learned more word-referent pairs than expected by chance, smallest t(37) = 8.785, p < .001, prep > .99, d = 1.425, one-tailed (4 × 4 condition). They discovered on average more than 16 of the 18 pairs in the 2 × 2 condition and more than 13 of the 18 pairs in the 3 × 3 condition—all this in less than 6 min of training per condition. Even in the 4 × 4 condition, with 16 potential associations per trial, subjects discovered almost 10 of the 18 word-referent pairs."*

The **error analysis** related to foil probabilities:

*"The spurious correlations in the training data are relevant to understanding these mechanisms and may suggest what subjects actually learned from their experience." "Specifically, errors would have been related to what we call foil probability, the probability that the foil at test had co-occurred with the word during training." *

### Differences from Original Study

The new reproducibility project will involve a different participant pool compared to the original study. While the original research tested undergraduate students, the replication will recruit participants from Prolific, an online platform that draws from a more diverse and varied population. This shift in sample composition could potentially affect the outcomes. Specifically, we might observe lower learning accuracy and greater variability in the results, as the broader demographic diversity of Prolific workers could introduce more variability in cognitive abilities, learning styles, and background knowledge compared to the more homogenous group of university students. This increased variability could lead to higher variance in the data, making it more challenging to replicate the precise findings of the original study.

### Methods Addendum (Post Data Collection)

You can comment this section out prior to final report with data collection.

#### Actual Sample
**Sample Size**: The experiment included 38 participants, all of whom were undergraduate students from Indiana University. Participants received either course credit or $7 for their participation.
**Demographics**: While the study does not provide detailed demographic information, the participants were likely college-aged and relatively homogenous in terms of educational background.
**Data Exclusions**: The summary does not explicitly mention any data exclusion criteria.

#### Differences from pre-data collection methods plan
none

### Confirmatory analysis
1. Test of Learning Accuracy:
The primary analysis will compare the participants' performance (number of correct word-referent pairings) across the three conditions: 2 × 2, 3 × 3, and 4 × 4 trials.
**Descriptive statistics**:mean correct word-referent pairings in each condition will be computed.
**One-sample t-tests**: will be used to determine whether the number of correct pairings is significantly greater than chance (25% in a four-alternative forced-choice test).
**Repeated-measures ANOVA**: will be conducted to compare performance across the three learning conditions to assess the effect of within-trial ambiguity on learning accuracy.
2. Exploring Variance:
Given that the original study used undergraduate students and the new replication will use a more diverse sample from Prolific, the variance in learning accuracy might be higher in the replication study.
Variability in performance will be assessed by examining the standard deviations and comparing them across conditions and between the original and replication samples.
3.Error Analysis:
An analysis of foil probability will be conducted to examine whether participants are more likely to select foils (incorrect referents) that frequently co-occurred with the tested word during training. This will help evaluate if errors are related to the strength of spurious word-referent associations.

### Exploratory analyses

Any follow-up analyses desired (not required).  

## Discussion

### Summary of Replication Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the confirmatory analysis and the assessment of whether it replicated, partially replicated, or failed to replicate the original result.  

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis, (b) assessment of the meaning of the replication (or not) - e.g., for a failure to replicate, are the differences between original and present study ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the replication attempt.  None of these need to be long.
